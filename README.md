# C++ Class Projects

This repository contains a collection of smaller projects and assignments I worked on during my C++ programming class. Each folder represents a specific lab or homework assignment where I practiced different programming concepts.

## Contents

- **Homework (hw1_1470, hw2_1470, etc.)**: Contains assignments focused on working with partner to make bigger projects.
- **Labs (lab01_1470, lab02_1470, etc.)**: Labs we worked by ourselfs to learn the concepts and be able to apply them to the Homeworks.

## Topics Covered

- Basic input/output
- Loops and conditional statements
- Functions and recursion
- Arrays and pointers
- Object-oriented programming
- File handling

These projects reflect my progress and understanding of C++ programming concepts throughout the course.

Feel free to explore the code and learn from my implementations!
